\begin{definition}[Open Cover]
    By an \textit{open cover} of a set \( E  \) in a metric space \( X  \) we mean a collection \( \{ {G}_{\alpha} \}  \) of open subsets of \( X  \) such that \( E \subset \bigcup_{ \alpha  }^{  } {G}_{\alpha} \).
\end{definition}   

\begin{definition}[Finite Subcover]
    A subset \( K  \) of a metrix space \( X  \) is said to be \textit{compact} if every open cover of \( K  \) contains a \textit{finite} subcover. That is, if \( \{ {G}_{\alpha} \}  \) is an open cover of \( K  \), then there are finitely many indices \( {\alpha}_{1}, {\alpha}_{2}, \dots , {\alpha}_{n} \) such that
    \[  K \subset \bigcup_{ \alpha_i }^{n  } {G}_{{\alpha}_{i}}. \]
\end{definition}



\begin{theorem}[ ]
    Suppose \( K \subset Y \subset X  \). Then \( K  \) is compact relative to \( X  \) if and only if \( K  \) is compact relative to \( Y  \).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[ ]
    Compact subsets of metric spaces are closed.

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[ ]
    Closed subsets of compact sets are compact.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
    If \( F  \) is closed and \( K  \) is compact, then \( F \cap K  \) is compact.
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}[ ]
    If \( \{ {K}_{\alpha} \}  \) is a collection of compact subsets of a metric space \( X  \) such that the intersection of every finite subcollection of \( \{ {K}_{\alpha} \}  \) is nonempty, then \( \bigcap_{  }^{  }  {K}_{\alpha} \) is nonempty.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    If \( \{ {K}_{n} \}   \) is a countable collection of nonempty compact sets such that \( {K}_{n} \supset {K}_{n+1} (n \in \N) \), then \( \bigcap_{ n=1  }^{ \infty  } {K}_{n} \) is nonempty.
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}[ ]
    If \( \{ {I}_{n} \}  \) is a sequence of intervals in \( \R^{1} \), such that \( {I}_{n} \supset {I}_{n+1} (n \in \N) \), then \( \bigcap_{ n=1  }^{ \infty  }  {I}_{n} \) is nonempty. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[ ]
    Let \( k  \) be a positive integer. If \( \{ {I}_{n} \}  \) is a sequence of \( k- \)cells such that \( {I}_{n} \supset {I}_{n+1} (n \in \N) \), then \( \bigcap_{ n=1  }^{ \infty  } {I}_{n} \) is nonempty.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}[ ]
    Every \( k- \)cell is compact.

\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}[ ]
    If a set \( E  \) in \( \R^{k} \) has one of the following three properties, then it has the other two:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(a)] \( E  \) is closed and bounded. 
        \item[(b)] \( E  \) is compact.
        \item[(c)] Every infinite subset of \( E  \) has a limit point in \( E  \).
    \end{enumerate}
