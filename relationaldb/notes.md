# Computers + Databases = <3

# Database Management Systems (DBMS)
- A special software program that helps users create and maintain a database
    - Security

# Database
- Websites interact with DMBS in order to `create, read, update, and delete information`
- These are the four main operations of database management

# Two Types of Databases
- Relational Databases (SQL)
    - Organize data into one or more tables
        - For each table, we have columns and rows
        - A unique key identifies each row.
- Non-Relational 
    - Organize anything into anything that is not a traditional table
        - Graphs
        - Documents

# Relational Databases (SQL)
- Use sql to interact with and main a relational database
- Use CRUD operations as well as other admin tasks to do this
- Define tables and structure
- Standardized language
- However, not all languages will be equivalent (will involve slight modifications)

# Non-Relational Databases
- noSQL
- Objects
- Graphs
- Documents
- Hash

# Create Tables
- Some basic information:
    - Data Types: 
        - INT (Whole numbers)
        - DECIMAL(M,N) ->  DECIMAL(10,4) 
        - VARCHAR(n) -> Max amount of characters to store of size n
