\section{The Definition of the Riemann Integral}

Before we have \textit{Riemann sums}, we need to construct \textit{upper sums}  and \textit{lower sums} using the notion of the supremum and infimum. In this section, let us assume that \( f  \) is defined on a closed interval \( [a,b]  \) where \( f  \) is bounded my some \( M > 0  \) on this interval; that is, \( | f(x)  | \leq M  \) for all \( x \in [a,b] \). 

\subsection{Partitions, Upper Sums, and Lower Sums}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{defn}
	A \textit{partition} \( P  \) of \( [a,b]  \) is a finite set of points from \( [a,b]  \) that includes both \( a  \) and \( b  \). The notational convention is to always list the points of a partition \( P = \{ x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n} \}  \) in increasing order; thus, \[  a = x_{0} < x_{1} < x_{2} < \dotsb < x_{n} = b. \]
	For each subinterval \( [x_{k-1}, x_{k} ] \) of \( P  \), let 
	\[  m_{k } = \inf \{ f(x) : x \in [x_{k-1} , x_{k } ] \} \ \text{ and } \  M_{k } = \sup \{ f(x) : x \in [x_{k-1}, x_{k }] \}. \]
	The \textit{lower sum} of \( f  \) respect to \( P  \) is given by 
	\[  L(f, P ) = \sum_{ k=1 }^{ n } m_{ k } ( x_{k } -  x_{ k -1 }). \]
	Likewise, we define the \textit{upper sum} of \( f  \) with respect to \( P  \) by 
	\[  U(f, P ) = \sum_{ k=1 }^{ n } M_k ( x_{k } - x_{ k -1 }). \]
\end{defn}
\end{tcolorbox}

It is clear from this definition that 
\[  U(f, P ) \leq L(f, P ).\]  This inequality holds even with respect to different partitions.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{defn}
A partition \( Q  \) is a \textit{refinement} of a partition \( P  \) if \( Q  \) contains all of the points of \( P  \); that is, if \( P \subseteq Q  \).



\end{defn}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{lem}
If \( P \subseteq Q  \), then \( L(f,P) \leq L(f,Q)  \), and \( U(f,P ) \geq U(f,Q) \).
\end{lem}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}
	First let us prove the inequality for the lower sums. Let \( P \subseteq Q  \). Suppose we refine \( P  \) by a adding a point \( z  \) to some subinterval \(  [x_{k-1}, x_{k }] \) of P. Then we have that 
	\begin{align*}
	    m_{k } ( x_{k } - x_{ k -1 })&= m_{  k } (x_{k } - z ) + m_{ k } (z - z _{k -1 })  \\
									 &\leq m'_{k }( x_{k } - z ) + m"_{k} (z - x_{k -1 }),
	\end{align*}
	where 
	\[  m'_{k} = \inf \{ f(x) : x \in [z, x_{k }] \} \  \ \text{ and } \  \ m"_{k} = \inf \{ f(x) : x \in [x_{k -1 }, z ] \}  \]
	are each necessarily as large or larget than \( m_k  \). We can use an induction argument to show that \(  L(f, P ) \leq L(f,Q) \). The same can be done for the upper sums.

	That is, take some point \( \ell \in [x_{k-1}, x_{k }] \) such that 
	\begin{align*}
	    M_{k } (x_{k} - x_{k -1 }) &= M_{k } (x_{ k } - \ell ) + M_{k } ( \ell - x_{k -1 }) \\
								   &\geq M_k' (x_{k } - \ell ) + M"_{k } (\ell - x_{k -1 }) \\
	\end{align*}
	\[  M'_{k} = \sup \{ f(x) : x \in [\ell, x_{k }] \} \  \ \text{ and } \  \ M"_{k}= \sup \{ f(x) : x \in [x_{k -1 }, \ell ] \}.  \]
	Using induction again to repeat the argument above, we can show that \( U(f, P) \geq U(f,Q) \).
\end{proof}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{lem}
	If \( P_1  \) and \( P_2  \) are any two partitions of \( [a,b]  \), then \( L(f, P_{1}) \leq U(f, P_2) \).
\end{lem}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}
Let \( Q = P_{1} \cup P_{2}  \) be the so-called \textit{common refinement} of \( P_{1} \) and \( P_{2} \). Because \(  P_{1} \subseteq Q  \) and \( P_{2} \subseteq Q  \), it follows that 
\[ L(f, P_{1}) \leq L(f,Q) \leq U(f,Q) \leq U(f, P_{2}).  \]
\end{proof}


\subsection{Integrability}

Another way of thinking Integrability is to think of the upper sums as an overestimate of the value of the integral and lower sums as an underestimate of the value of the integral. We can see that as the we continually refine our partitions, the upper sums become smaller and smaller and the lower sums become larger and larger until they meet at some common point in the middle. 
	Rather than thinking of this whole process as the limit of these sums, we will instead make use of the Axiom of Completeness and consider the \textit{infimum} of the upper sums and the \textit{supremum} of the lower sums.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{defn}
	Let \( \mathcal{P}  \) be the collection of all possible partitions of the interval \( [a,b] \). The \textit{upper integral} of \( f \) is defined to be 
	\[  U(f) = \inf \{ U(f,P) : P \in \mathcal{P} \}.  \]
	In a similar way, define the \textit{lower integral} of \( f  \) by 
	\[  L(f) = \sup \{ L(f,P) : P \in \mathcal{P}. \}  \]
\end{defn}
\end{tcolorbox}
 The following fact is not surprising. 
\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{lem}
	For any bounded function \( f  \) on \( [a,b]  \), it is always the case that \( U(f) \leq L(f) \).
\end{lem}
\end{tcolorbox}
Why is this not surprising you ask? It is because \( U(f) \) is the exact definition for what it means to be the least upper bound and \( L(f)  \) is the exact definition for what it means to be the greatest upper bound.

\begin{tcolorbox}
	\begin{defn}[Riemann Integrability]
	A bounded function \( f  \) defined on the interval \( [a,b] \) is \textit{Riemann-integrable} if \( U(f) = L(f) \). In this case, we define \( \int_{ a }^{ b } f   \) or \( \int_{ a }^{ b } f(x) \ dx \) to be this common value; namely, 
	\[  \int_{ a }^{ b } f  = U(f) = L(f). \]
	\end{defn}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Criteria for Integrability} 

To summarize, we know that it is always the case that for a bounded function  \( f  \) on a closed interval \( [a,b]  \), we have 
\[  \sup \{ L(f,P) : P \in \mathcal{P} \} = L(f) \leq U(f) = \inf \{ U(f,P) : P \in \mathcal{P} \}.\] For \( f  \) to be integrable, the inequaltity above must be an equality. More rigorously, finding our if a function is integrable is equivalent to the existence of partitions whose upper and lower sums are arbitrarly close together.

\begin{tcolorbox}
	\begin{thm}[Integrability Criterion]
		A bounded function \(  f \) is integrable on \( [a,b]  \) if and only if, for every \( \epsilon > 0  \), there exists a partition \( P_{\epsilon } \) of \( [a,b] \) such that 
		\[  U(f, P_{\epsilon }) - L(f, P_{\epsilon }) < \epsilon. \]
	\end{thm}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}
	(\( \Leftarrow \))Let \( \epsilon > 0  \). If such a partition \( P_{\epsilon } \) of \( [a,b]  \) exists, then we have
	\[ U(f) - L(f) \leq U(f, P_{\epsilon }) - L(f, P_{\epsilon }) < \epsilon. \]
	Since \( \epsilon  \) is arbitrary, we know by Theorem 1.2.6 that \( U(f) = L(f) \).Hence, \( f  \) is integrable.  
	(\( \Rightarrow \)) 

	The proof for the forwards direction works more like using the triangle inequality but this time with parentheses in place of absolute values. Since \( U(f)  \) is just the greatest lower bound of the upper sums, we know that, given some \( \epsilon > 0  \), there must exists a partition \( P_{1} \) such that 
	\[  U(f, P_{1}) < U(f) + \frac{ \epsilon  }{ 2 }. \tag{1} \]
	Likewise, there exists a partition \( P_{2}  \) satisfying 
	\[  L(f, P_{2}) > L(f) - \frac{ \epsilon  }{ 2 } \iff -L(f, P_{2}  ) < \frac{ \epsilon  }{ 2 } - L(f). \tag{2} \]
	Adding (1) and (2) together, we end up with 
	\[  U(f, P_{1}) - L(f, P_{2}) < ( U(f) - L(f)) + \epsilon.  \]
	Because \( f  \) is integrable on \( [a,b]  \), we have \( L(f) = U(f)  \) which implies that 
	\begin{align*}
	    U(f, P_{\epsilon }) - L(f, P_{\epsilon}) &\leq  U(f, P_{1}) - L(f, P_{2})  \\
												 &< (U(f) - L(f)) + \epsilon \\
												 &= \epsilon.
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}

At the beginning of this section, it was clear that a function's integrability was tied to its continuity. To make this precise, let us consider the arbitrary partition \( P = \{ x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n} \}  \) of \( [a,b]  \), and let us define \( \delta x_{k } = x_{k } - x_{k-1 } \). Then, 
\[  U(f,P) - L(f,P) = \sum_{ k=1 }^{ n } (M_{k } - m_{k } ) \Delta x_{ k }, \]
where \( M _{k }  \) and \( m_{ k }  \) are the supremum and infimum of \( f  \) on the subinterval \( [x_{k -1 } , x_{ k  }] \) (as defined before) respectively. The size of 
\[  U(f,P) - L(f,P)   \] is dependent upon the size of the differences of our extremums \(  M_{k } - m_{k } \), which can be interpreted as the variation of the range of \( f  \) over the interval \( [x_{k-1 }, x_{k }] \). This variation and its restriction of our function \( f  \) on arbitrarly small intervals on \( [a,b]  \) is \textit{precisely} what it means fopr \( f  \) to be uniformly continuous on \( [a,b] \).

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{thm}
	If \( f  \) is continuous on \( [a,b] \), then it is integrable.
\end{thm}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{proof}
	Since \( f  \) is continuous on the compact set \( [a,b]  \), we know that \( f  \) must be uniformly continuous on \( [a,b]  \). Let \( \epsilon > 0  \) and choose \( \delta = \epsilon / b -a  \) where \( b = x_{n}   \) and \( a = x_{1}  \) are the endpoints of the interval \( [a,b ] \). Then whenever \( | x - y  | < \delta  \), we have that 
	\[  | f(x) - f(y)  | < \frac{ \epsilon  }{  b - a  }. \]
	Now, let \( P  \) be a partition of \( [a,b]  \) where \( \Delta x_{ k } = x_{ k } - x _{ k -1 } \) is less than \( \delta  \) for every subinterval \( [x_{k-1 } , x_{k }] \) of \( P  \). Given a particular subinterval \( [x_{k-1}, x_{ k } ] \subseteq [a,b]   \), we can use the Extreme Value Theorem, to state that the supremum \(  M_{k} = f(z_{k })  \) for some \( z_{k } \in [x_{ k-1 } , x_{k}]  \) as well as the infimum \( m_{k } = f(y_{k }) \) for some \( y_{ k } \in [x_{k -1 } , x_{ k }]  \). But this means that whenever \( | z_{k } - y_{k } | < \delta  \), we have 
	\[  M_{k } - m_{k } = f(z_{k}) - f(y_{k } ) < \frac{ \epsilon  }{  b -a  }. \]
	This implies that 
	\[  U(f, P ) - L(f,P ) = \sum_{ k=1 }^{ n } (M_{k } - m_{ k } ) \Delta x_{k} < \frac{ \epsilon  }{ b -a  }  \sum_{ k=1 }^{ n } \Delta x_{k} = \epsilon \]
	and \( f  \) is integrable by the criterion provided in Theorem 7.2.8.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercises}

\subsubsection{Exercise 7.2.1} Let \( f  \) be a bounded function on \( [a,b]  \), and let \( P  \) be an arbitrary parititon of \(  [a,b]  \). First, explain why \( U(f) \geq L(f,P)  \). Now, prove Lemma 7.2.6.
\begin{proof}
By definition, we know that 
\[  U(f) = \inf \{ U(f,P) : P \in \mathcal{P} \}  \] and \( U(f,P)   \), for any given partition \( P \in \mathcal{P} \), is an upper bound of the set \( \mathcal {L} = \{ L(f,P) 
: P \in \mathcal{P}\}  \). Since \( U(f)  \) is any upper bound of \( \mathcal{L} \) and \( L(f)  \) is the \textit{least upper bound} then, we know that \( U(f) \geq L(f,P) \). Then given an arbitrary \( \epsilon > 0  \), we can find some partition \( P_{\epsilon } \in \mathcal{P} \) such that 
\[  L(f) - \epsilon < L(f, P_{\epsilon }) \leq U(f)  \]
which implies that 
\[  L(f) \leq U(f) + \epsilon. \]
Since \( \epsilon > 0  \) is arbitrary, we know that \( U(f) \geq L(f) \).
\end{proof}


\subsubsection{Exercise 7.2.3 (Sequential Criterion for Integrability)} 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(a)] Prove that a bounded function \( f  \) is integrable on \( [a,b]  \) if and only if there exists a sequence of partitions \( (P_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty } \) satisfying 
		\[  \lim_{ n \to \infty  }  [U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n})] = 0,  \]
		and in this case \( \int_{ a }^{ b }  f = \lim_{ n \to \infty  }  U(f, P_{n} ) = \lim_{ n \to \infty  }  L(f, P_{n}). \)
		\begin{proof}
		First we prove the forwards direction. We can find a \textit{common refinement} where \( Q = P_{1} \cup P_{2} \) such that \( P_{1} \subseteq Q  \) and \( P_{2} \subseteq Q  \). Given that \( f  \) is bounded, let \( \epsilon > 0  \) such that the following statements can be made:
		\begin{align*}
			U(f, P_1) &< U(f) + \frac{ \epsilon  }{ 2  }  \iff U(f, P_{1}) - U(f) < \frac{ \epsilon  }{ 2 } \\
			L(f, P_{2}) &> L(f) - \frac{ \epsilon  }{ 2 } \iff L(f) - L(f, P_{2}) < \frac{ \epsilon  }{ 2 } .
		\end{align*}
		Now assume \( L(f) = U(f) \). Then for some \( N \in \N  \), we assume that for any \( n \geq N  \), we have
		\begin{align*}
		    | U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) | &\leq | U(f, P_{1}) - L(f, P_{2}) |  \\
										  &= | U(f, P_{1}) - U(f)  +  U(f) - L(f)   +  L(f) - L(f, P ) | \\
										  &\leq | U(f, P_{1}) - U(f)  |  + | U(f) - L(f)  | + | L(f) - L(f, P ) | \\
										  &= | U(f,P_{1}) - U(f)  |  + | L(f) - L(f,P) | \\
										  &< \frac{ \epsilon  }{ 2  } + \frac{ \epsilon  }{ 2  } = \epsilon.
		\end{align*}

		Now we shall prove the backwards direction. Choose \( \epsilon = 1/n   \). Assume there exists a partition \( P_{n} \) such that for some \( N \in \N  \), we have that for any \( n \geq N  \)
		\[  U(f) - L(f) \leq U(f, P_{n})  - L(f, P_{n}) < \frac{ 1 }{ n } \to 0. \]
		But by Theorem 1.2.6, we have that \( U(f) = L(f) \). Hence, \( f  \) must be integrable.
		\end{proof}
	\item[(b)] For each \( n  \), let \( P_{n} \) be the partition of \( [0,1] \) into \( n \) equal subintervals. Find formulas for \( U(f, P_{n}) \) and \( L(f,P_{n}) \) if \( f(x) = x  \). The formula \( 1 + 2 + 3 + \dotsb + n = n(n+1)/2  \) will be useful.
		\begin{proof}[Solution]
			Let \( f(x) = x  \). Then for each \( n \in \N  \), let \( x_{k } = k / n  \). Then using the formula \( 1 + 2 + 3 + \dotsb + n = n(n+1) / 2 \), we attain the formula for the \textit{Upper Sum}  
			\begin{align*}
			   U(f, P_{n}) &= \sum_{ k=1 }^{ n } M_{k } ( x_{k } -  x_{k -1 } ) \\
						   &= \sum_{ k=1 }^{ n } \frac{ k  }{ n } \Big(  \frac{ k  }{ n } - \frac{ k-1 }{ n } \ \Big) \\
						   &= \sum_{ k=1 }^{ n } \frac{ k  }{ n^2 } \\
						   &= \frac{ n(n+1) }{ 2n^2 } \\
						   &= \frac{ n+1 }{ 2n }. \\ 
			\end{align*}
		Similarly, we can let \( x_{k-1} = (k-1)/n \) to attain the formula for the \textit{Lower Sum} 
		\begin{align*}
		    L(f, P_{n})&= \sum_{ k=1 }^{ n } m_{k } ( x_{k} - x_{k-1}) \\
					   &= \sum_{ k=1 }^{ n } \frac{ k-1 }{ n } \Big( \frac{ k-1 }{ n } - \frac{ k-2 }{ n }  \Big) \\
					   &= \sum_{ k=1 }^{ n } \frac{ k-1 }{ n^2 } \\
					   &= \frac{ n^{2} + n - 2  }{ 2 n^{2} }. 
		\end{align*}
		Hence, we have the following formulas:
		\begin{align*}
		    U(f, P_{n}) &= \frac{ n^2 + n  }{ 2n^2 } \\
			L(f, P_{n}) &=  \frac{ n^{2} + n - 2  }{ 2n^2 } 
		\end{align*}
		\end{proof}
	\item[(c)] Use the sequential criterion for integrability from (a) to show directly that \( f(x) = x  \) is integrable on \( [0,1]  \) and compute \( \int_{ 0 }^{ 1 } f   \).
		\begin{proof}[Solution]
			To show that \( f(x)  \) integrable on \( [0,1] \), all we need to show is 
			\[  \lim_{ n \to \infty  }  [ U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n })] = 0.  \]
			Indeed, we have 
			\begin{align*}
			    \lim_{ n \to \infty  }  [ U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n })] &= \lim_{ n \to \infty  } \frac{ 1 }{ n^2 }  \\
																	  &= 0. 
			\end{align*}
			Hence, \( f(x) = x  \) is integrable on \( [0,1] \). For large \( n  \), we know that 
			\( U(f) \leq 1 /2  \) and \( L(f) \geq 1 / 2  \). Since \( U(f) = L(f)  \), we know that 
			\[  \int_{ a }^{ b } f  = \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }. \]
		\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Exercise 7.2.4} Let \( g  \) be bounded on \( [a,b]  \) and assume there exists a partition \( P  \) with \( L(f, P) = U(g,P)  \). Is \( g  \) necessarily continuous? Is it integrable? If so, what is the value of \( \int_{ a }^{ b }  g \).
\begin{proof}[Solution]
	Yes, \( g  \) is continuous since it is just the constant function and constant functions are continuous. Let \( \epsilon > 0  \). It is integrable becuse there exists a partition \( P_{\epsilon } \) such that \( L(g,P_{\epsilon }) = U(g,P_{\epsilon })  \) implies that 
	\[ U(g,P) - L(g,P) < \epsilon.  \] Furthemore, we have \( \int_{ a }^{ b }  g = g(x_{k }) \Delta x_{k } \).
\end{proof}





\subsubsection{Exercise 7.2.5} Assume that, for each \( n  \), \( f_{n} \) is an integrable function on \( [a,b]  \). If \( (f_n) \to f  \) uniformly on \( [a,b]   \), prove that \( f  \) is also integrable on this set. (We will see that this conclusion does not necessarily follow if the convergence is pointwise.)
\begin{proof}
	Let \( \epsilon > 0  \). Since \( f_{n} \) is integrable on \( [a,b]  \), there exists a partition \( P_{\epsilon } \) such that 
	\[ U(f_{n}, P_{\epsilon }) - L(f_{n}, P_{\epsilon }) < \epsilon. \]
	Since \( (f_{n}) \to f  \) uniformly, we can bound the difference of the upper sums between \( f_{n} \) and \( f  \) by choosing \( N_{1} \in \N  \) such that for any \( n \geq N_{1}  \), we have
	\[  U(f, P_{\epsilon }) - U(f_{n}, P_{\epsilon }) = (M_{k} - f_{n}(\ell_k)) \sum_{ k=1 }^{ n } \Delta x_{k } < \frac{ \epsilon  }{  3(b -a)  } \sum_{ k=1 }^{ n } \Delta x_{ k }  \] for some \( \ell_{k } \in [x_{k-1}, x_{k }] \) and similarly choosing \( N_{2} \in \N  \) such that for any \( n \geq N_{2} \)
	\[  L(f_n, P_{\epsilon }) - L(f, P_{\epsilon }) = ( f_{n}(s_{k }) - m_{k}) \sum_{ k=1 }^{ n } \Delta x_{k } < \frac{ \epsilon  }{  3(b -a)  } \sum_{ k=1 }^{ n } \Delta x_{ k }.\] Furthermore, we must also choose \( N_{3} \in \N  \) such that for any \( n \geq N_{3} \) 
	\[  | U(f_{n}, P_{\epsilon }) - L(f_{n}, P_{\epsilon }) | < \frac{ \epsilon  }{ 3 (b-a) } . \]
	Then we can find an \( N = \max \{ N_{1}, N_{2}, N_{3} \}   \) such that for any \( n \geq N  \)
	\begin{align*}
		U(f, P_{\epsilon }) - L(f, P_{\epsilon }) &= U(f, P_{\epsilon }) - U(f_n, P_{\epsilon }) + U(f_{n}, P_{\epsilon }) - L(f_{n}, P_{\epsilon }) \\ 
												  &+ L(f_{n}, P_{\epsilon }) - L(f, P_{\epsilon }) \\
												  &< \frac{ \epsilon  }{ b - a  } \sum_{ k=1 }^{ n } \Delta x_{k} = \epsilon.
	\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Exercise 7.2.6} A \textit{tagged partition} \( (P, \{ c_{k } \} ) \) is one where in addition to a partition \( P  \) we choose a sampling point \( c_{k } \) in each of the subintervals \( [ x_{k-1} , x_{k }]  \). The corresponding \textit{Riemann Sum}, 
\[  R(f, P ) = \sum_{ k=1 }^{ n } f(c_{k }) \Delta x_{k },  \] is discussed in Section 7.1, where the following definition is alluded to. 
\begin{tcolorbox}
	\begin{defn}[Riemann's Original Definition of the Integral]
	A bounded function \( f  \) is \textit{integrable} on \( [a,b]  \) with \( \int_{ a }^{ b } f = A  \) if for all \( \epsilon > 0   \) there exists \( \delta > 0  \) such that for any tagged partition \( (P, \{ c_{k } \} ) \) satisfying \( \Delta x_{k } < \delta  \) for all \( k  \), it follows that 
	\[  | R(f,P) - A  | < \epsilon. \]
	\end{defn}
\end{tcolorbox}

Show that if \( f  \) satisfies Riemann's definition above, then \( f  \) is integrable in the sense of Definition 7.2.7.

\begin{proof}
Let \( \epsilon > 0  \) and let \( (P_n, \{ c_{k } \} ) \) be a tagged partition satisfying  \( \Delta x_{k} < \delta_1   \) for all  \( k \). It suffices to show that there exists some \( \delta > 0  \) such that our arbitrary tagged partition defined above must imply that
\[  | U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) | < \epsilon.  \]
Let \( P_{1} \) and \( P_{2} \) be any two partitions of \( [a,b]  \). We can attain a common refinement by taking \( P_{1} \cup P_{2} = P_{n} \) where \( P_{1} \subseteq P_{n} \) and \( P_{2} \subseteq P_{n} \). Suppose we take tag partitions \( P_{1} \) and \( P_{2} \) so that we may pick sampling points \( \ell_{k } \) and \( d_{ k }  \) in \( [x_{k-1} , x_{k}] \). Since \( f  \) is integrable on \( [a,b]  \), there must exist \( \delta_1, \delta_2  > 0  \) such that for tagged partitions \( (P_{n}, \{ \ell_k  \} )  \) and \( ( P_{1}, \{ d_{k } \} ) \) satisfying \( \Delta x_{k } < \delta_1  \) and \( \Delta x_{k } < \delta_2  \) respectively, we must have
\[  | U(f, P_{n}) - R(f, P_{1}) | < \frac{ \epsilon  }{ 4 }.\]
Similarly, pick a sampling point \( z_{k } \) in \( [x_{k-1}, x_{ k }] \) such that for some \( \delta_3 > 0  \), we can choose \( (P_{2}, \{ z_{k} \} ) \) satisfying \( \Delta x_{k } < \delta_3  \)
\[  | R(f, P_{2}) - L(f, P_{n}) | < \frac{ \epsilon  }{ 4 }.  \]
Furthermore, the integrability of \( f  \) also implies that 
\begin{align*}
	| R(f, P_{1}) - R(f,P_{2}) |   &\leq | R(f, P_{1}) - A  | + | A - R(f, P_{2}) | \\ 
								   &< \frac{ \epsilon }{ 4  } + \frac{ \epsilon  }{ 4  }.   \\
\end{align*}
Hence, we can find \( \delta = \min \{ \delta_{1}, \delta_{2}, \delta_{3}  \}  > 0  \) such that for any partition \( (P_{n}, \min \{ z_{k}, \ell_{k }, d_{k } \} ) \) satisfying \( \Delta x_{k } < \delta  \) for all \( k  \), we have
\begin{align*}
	| U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) | &\leq | U(f, P_{n}) - R(f, P_{1})   | + | R(f, P_{1}) - R(f, P_{2}) | \\ &+ | R(f,P_{2}) - L(f, P_{n}) |  \\
								  &\leq | U(f, P_{n}) - R(f, P_{1}) | + | R(f, P_{1}) - A | \\ &+  | A  - R(f, P_{2}) | + | R(f, P_{2}) - L(f, P_{n}) |  \\  
								  &< \frac{ \epsilon  }{ 4  } + \frac{ \epsilon  }{ 4  }  + \frac{ \epsilon  }{ 4  } + \frac{ \epsilon  }{ 4  } \\
								  &= \epsilon.
\end{align*}
By the Integrability Criterion, \( f  \) is integrable on \( [a,b] \).
