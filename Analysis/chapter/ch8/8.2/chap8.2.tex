\section{Metric Spaces and the Baire Category Theorem}

In this section, we aim to give a more generalized view of what it means to have a "distance" over sets other than \( \R  \). Do the theorems and properties we have proved about sequences, series, and functions carry over to sets like \( \R^{2} \) or even in higher dimensions like \( \R^n \)? We will be mainly testing our notions that we have developed throughout the book on sets such as \( \R^{2} \) and \( C[0,1] \), the space of continuous functions on \( [0,1] \).


\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{defn}
Given a set \( X  \), a function \( d: X \times X \to \R  \) is a \textit{metric} on \( X  \) if for all \( x,y \in X  \):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)]\( d(x,y) \geq 0  \) with \( d(x,y) =0  \) if and only if \( x = y  \),
    \item[(ii)] \( d(x,y) = d(y,x)  \), and 
    \item[(iii)] for all \( z \in X \), \( d(x,y) \leq d(x,z) + d(z,y) \).
\end{enumerate}
A \textit{metric space} is a set \( X  \) together with a metric \( d  \).
\end{defn}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Property (iii) in the definition above is just the triangle inequality.
    \item The set \( X  \) can have different metrics on it.
    \item Whenever a metric space is mentioned, we usually specify what metric are using.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Exercise 8.2.1} Decide which of the following are metrics on \( X = \R^2  \). For each, we let \( x = (x_{1}, x_{2}) \) and \( y = (y_{1}, y_{2}) \) be points in the plane.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] \( d(x,y) = \sqrt{ (x_{1}- y_{1})^2 + (x_{2} - y_{2})^{2} }. \)
    \item[(b)] \( d(x,y) = \max \{ | x_{1} - y_{1} |, | x_{2} - y_{2} |  \}. \)
    \item[(c)] \( d(x,y) = | x_{1} x_{2} + y_{1} y_{2} |  \).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(a)]  We claim that \( d(x,y)  \) is a metric on \( X = \R^{2} \). Let \( x', y' \in \R^{2} \) where \( x = (x_{1}, x_{2}) \) and \( y = (y_{1}, y_{2}) \). For part (i), suppose \( x' \neq y' \). Then observe that by property of the square root, we know that \( d(x,y) >  0  \). Otherwise, \( d(x,y) = 0  \). 

            For part (ii), observe that 
            \begin{align*}
                d(x,y) &= \sqrt{ (x_{1} - y_{1})^2 + (x_{2} - y_{2})^{2} }  \\
                       &= \sqrt{ (y_{1} - x_{1})^2 + (y_{2} - x_{2})^{2} } \\
                       &= d(y,x).
            \end{align*} 
        For part(iii), let \( x,y, z \in \R^2  \). Then observe that 
        \begin{align*}
            d(x,y) &= \sqrt{ (x_{1} - y_{1})^2 + (x_{2} - y_{2})^2  }  \\
                   &= \sqrt{ (x_{1} - z_{1})^2 + (x_{2} - z_{2})^{2} + (z_{1} - y_{1})^{2} + (z_{2} - y_{2})^{2}  } \\ 
                   &\leq \sqrt{ (x_{1} - z_{1})^2 + (x_{2}  - z_{2})^2   }  + \sqrt{ (z_{1} - y_{1})^2 + (z_{2} - y_{2})^{2} } \\
                   &= d(x,z) + d(z,y).
        \end{align*}
        Hence, we conclude that \( d(x,y)  \) is a metric on \( \R^{2}  \).
    \item[(b)] We have \( d(x,y) = \max \{ | x_{1} - y_{1}  |, | x_{2} - y_{2} |  \}  \) is a metric on \( \R^2  \). 
        For property (i), observe that \( d(x,y) > 0  \) if either \( x \geq y  \) or \( x < y  \). This holds because \( |  \cdot | > 0  \). If \( x = y  \), then it follows immediately that \( d(x,y) = 0   \). To show the triangle inequality, we will use the formula 
        \[ \max \{ a,b \}  = a + b + | | a | - | b |  |.  \]
        Then observe that for any \( x,y,z \in \R^2 \), we have 
        \begin{align*}
            d(x,y) &= \max \{ | x_{1} - y_{1} | , | x_{2} - y_{2} |  \}  \\
                   &= \frac{ 1 }{ 2 } \Big[ | x_{1} - y_{1} |  + | x_{2} - y_{2} |  + | | x_{1} -  x_{1}  | + | x_{2} - y_{2} |   |  \Big] \\
                   &\leq \frac{ 1 }{ 2 } \Big[ | x_{1} - z_{1} | + | z_{1} - y_{1}   |   + | x_{2} - z_{2} | + | z_{2} - y_{2} |  \\ 
                   &+ \Big| | x_{1} -  z_{1}  | + | z_{1} - y_{1} |  - | x_{2} - z_{2} | + | z_{2} - y_{2} |    \Big|  \Big] \\
                   &= \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }  \Big[  | x_{1} - z_{1}  |  + | x_{2} - z_{2} | + \Big| | x_{1} - z_{1} |  - | x_{2} - z_{2} |  \Big|  \Big] \\ 
                   &+ \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }  \Big[ | z_{1} - y_{1} | + | z_{2} - y_{2} | + \Big| | z_{1} - y_{1}  |  - | z_{2} - y_{2} |  \Big|   \Big] \\
                   &= \max \{ | x_{1} -  z_{1} |, | x_{2} - z_{2} |  \} + \max \{ | z_{1} - y_{1} |, | z_{2} - y_{2} |  \} \\ 
                   &= d(x,z) +  d(z,y). 
        \end{align*}
    \item[(c)] \( d(x,y) = | x_{1}x_{2} + y_{1}y_{2} |  \) cannot be a metric since \( d(x,y) \neq 0  \) for all \( x,y \in \R^{2} \).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The metric in part (a) is the Euclidean distance between two points in a plane.
    \item \( d(x,y) = |   x - y  |   \) is a metric over \( \R  \) (the main metric we have been working with throughout the book).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Exercise 8.2.2} Let \( C[0,1]  \) be the collection of continuous functions on the closed interval \( [0,1]  \). Decide which of the following are metrics on \( C[0,1] \).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] \( d(f,g) = \sup \{ | f(x) - g(x)  | : x \in [0,1] \}  \).
    \item[(b)] \( d(f,g) = | f(1) - g(1) |  \).
    \item[(c)] \( d(f,g) = \int_{ 0 }^{ 1 }  | f - g |   \).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Observe that for any two functions \( f, g \in C[0,1] \) that are distinct, we know that 
        \[  d(f,g) = \sup \{ | f(x) - g(x)  |: x \in [0,1]  \} \geq | f(x) - f(x)  | > 0. \]
        If \( f = g  \), then it immediately follows that \( d(f,g) = 0  \). Hence, property (i) is satisfied.  

        Observe that part (ii) is satisfied by taking 
        \begin{align*}  d(f,g) &= \sup \{ | f(x) - g(x)  | : x \in [0,1] \} \\ &= \sup \{ | g(x) - f(x)  | : x \in [0,1] \} \\  &= d(g,f). \end{align*}

        For part (iii), let \( f,g,h \in C[0,1] \), then we must have 
        \begin{align*}
            d(f,g) &= \sup | f(x) - g(x) |  \\
                   &= \sup | f(x) - h(x) + h(x) - g(x) | \\
                   &\leq \sup | f(x) - h(x)  | + \sup | h(x) - g(x) | \\
                   &= d(f,h) + d(h,g).
        \end{align*}
    \item[(b)] The first property fails (take \( f(1) = 1  \) and \( g(x) = x  \)).
    \item[(c)] We claim that \( d(f,g) = \int_{ 0 }^{ 1 } | f - g  |     \) is a metric on \( \R^{2} \).    Note that for any two distinct functions \( f,g \in C[0,1]  \), we must have \( | f -g  | > 0  \). By exercise 7.4.4, we must have \( \int_{ 0 }^{ 1 }  | f - g  |   > 0  \). Otherwise, \( f = g  \) implies \( \int_{ 0 }^{ 1 }  | f - g  |  = 0  \). If \( \int_{ 0 }^{ 1 }  | f -g  |  =0  \), then we must have \( | f -g  | = 0  \) and hence, \( f = g  \). To show the triangle inequality, let \( f,g,h \in C[0,1] \) be integrable (since they are part of a set of continuous functions that are bounded). Hence, observe that 
        \begin{align*}
            d(f,g) &= \int_{ 0 }^{ 1 } | f -g  |    \\
                   &\leq \int_{ 0 }^{ 1 }  | f- h  |  + | h - g  |  \\
                   &= \int_{ 0 }^{ 1 } | f -h  | + \int_{ 0 }^{ 1 } | h - g  |  \\
                   &= d(f,h)  + d(h,g).
        \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

Define the \textit{discrete metric} on any set \( X  \) where for any \( x, y \in X  \), let 
\[  \rho (x,y) = 
\begin{cases}
    1 \  &\text{ if } x \neq y \\
    0 \ &\text{ if } x = y.
\end{cases}  \]

\subsection{Basic Definitions}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{defn}
Let \( (X,d)  \) be a metric space. A sequence \( (x_{n}) \subseteq  X  \) \textit{converges} to an element \( x \in X  \) if for all \( \epsilon > 0  \) there exists an \( N \in \N  \) such that \( d(x_{n} ,x )  < \epsilon \) whenever \( n \geq N  \).
\end{defn}
\end{tcolorbox}


\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{defn}
A sequence \( (x_{n}) \) in a metric space is a \textit{Cauchy sequence} if for all \( \epsilon > 0  \), there exists an \( N \in \N  \) such that \( d(x_{m}, x_{n}) < \epsilon \) whenever \( m, n \geq N  \).
\end{defn} 
\end{tcolorbox}
