\subsection*{Exercise 6.3.5} Let \( T  \) be a linear operator on an inner product space \( V  \). Let \( {U}_{1} = T + T^{*} \) and \( {U}_{2} = TT^{*} \). Prove that \( {U}_{1} = {U}_{1}^{*} \) and \( {U}_{2} = {U}_{2}^{*} \).

\end{proof}

\subsection*{Exercise 6.3.8} Let \( V \) be a finite-dimensional inner product space, and let \( T  \) be a linear operator on \( V  \). Prove that if \( T  \) is invertible, then \( T^{*}  \) is invertible and \( (T^{*})^{-1} = (T^{-1})^{*} \).

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\subsection*{Exercise 6.3.9} Prove that if \( V = W \oplus W^{\perp} \) and \( T  \) is the projection on \( W  \) along \( W^{\perp} \) then \( T = T^{*} \).
