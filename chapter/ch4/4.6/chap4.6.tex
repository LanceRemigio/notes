\section{Sets of Discontinuity} 

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{defn}
Given a function \( f: \R \to \R  \), we call the set \( D_f \subseteq \R  \) to be the set of points where the function \( f  \) fails to be continuous.
\end{defn}
\end{tcolorbox}

Some examples of sets of discontinuous points are
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] \( D_g = \R  \) in the case for Dirichlet's function, 
    \item[(b)] and \( D_{h} = \R \setminus \{ 0 \}  \) in the case of the modified Dirichlet's function, and 
    \item[(c)] lastly, \( D_{t} = \Q  \) for Thomae's function \( t(x)  \).
\end{enumerate}

We can always write the set of discontinuous points for a function \( D_f  \) as a countable union of closed sets. For monotone functions, these closed sets can taken as single points.
