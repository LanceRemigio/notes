\begin{definition}[Sequence]
    We call a \textbf{sequence}, we mean a function \( f  \) on the set \( \N  \).    
\end{definition}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We can let \( {x}_{n} = f(n) \). Then it is customary to denote the sequence \( f  \) by \( ({x}_{n})_{n \geq 1} \) or \( {x}_{1}, {x}_{2}, \dots  \).
    \item Note that \( {x}_{1}, {x}_{2}, \dots  \) need not be distinct.
    \item If for all \( n \in \N  \), \( {x}_{n} \in A  \), then we say \( ({x}_{n})_{n \geq1} \) is a sequence in \( A  \).
    \item Sometimes it is convenient to replace \( \N  \) in the definition above with \( \{ 0,1,2,\dots \}  \) or \( \{ -1,0,1,2, \dots \}  \).
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}[ ] 
    Every infinite subset of a countable set is countable.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let \( A  \) be a countable set. Let \( E \subseteq A  \) and \( E  \) is infinite. Our goal is to show that \( E  \) is countable. Since \( A  \) is countable, there exists a bijective function \( g: \N \to A  \), so 
\[  A = \{ g(n) : n \in \N \} = \{ {x}_{n} : n \in \N \} \]
with \( {x}_{n} = g(n) \) for all \( n \in \N \).
Now, let us construct the sequence \( {n}_{1}, {n}_{2}, \dots  \) as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(1)] Let \( {n}_{1}  \) be the smallest positive integer such that \( {x}_{{n}_{1}} \in E  \). 
    \item[(2)] Let \( {n}_{2} \) 
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

                    \item Find an injective function \( g: A \to B  \)
                    \item Find an injective function \( h: B \to A  \).
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
\item A countable union of countable sets is countable \textbf{AND}
\item A finite product of countable sets is countable. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{theorem}[D]
Let \( A  \) be the set of all sequences whose terms are the digits \( 0  \) and \( 1  \) (that is \( A  \) is the collection of all binary sequences). This set \( A  \) is uncountable. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
First, notice that \( A  \) is infinite. Let \( h: \N \to A   \) be the function defined by 
\[  \text{for all} \ h(n) = \text{The binary sequence whose \( n \)th term is the digit 1 and all other terms are zero}. \]
Clearly, \( h  \) is an injective map. Hence, \( h: \N \to h(\N) \) is bijective. We have \( \N \sim h(\N) \), and so \( h(\N)  \) is infinite. Note that \( h(\N) \subseteq A  \). Thus, \( A  \) is infinite 

Suppose for sake of contradiction that \( A  \) is NOT uncountable. Since \( A  \) is infinite and not uncountable, this assumption tells us that \( A  \) must be countable. Thus, there exists a bijective map \( f: \N \to A  \). So, we can write
\[  A = \{ f(n) : n \in \N  \}.  \]
This means that for each \( n \in \N  \), \( f(n) \) is a binary sequence. Let 
\begin{align*}
    f(1) &= ({a}_{1}^{1}, {a}_{2}^{1}, \dots) \\
    f(2) &= ({a}_{1}^{2}, {a}_{2}^{2} , \dots ) \\
    f(3) &= ({a}_{1}^{3}, {a}_{2}^{3} , \dots ) \\
         &\vdots \\
    f(n) &= ({a}_{1}^{n}, {a}_{2}^{n}, \dots) \\
        &\vdots
\end{align*}
The goal is to construct a binary sequence \( ({b}_{1}, {b}_{2}, \dots ) \) that is not in this list! This will contradict the fact that \( A  \) contains all the binary sequences.  

Define 
\[  {b}_{1} = 
\begin{cases}
    0 &\text{if} \ {a}_{1}^{1} = 1  \\
    1 &\text{if} \ {a}_{1}^{1} = 0 
\end{cases}  \]
Similarly, for the second term, we see that 
\[  {b}_{2} = 
\begin{cases}
    0 &\text{if} \ {a}_{2}^{2} = 1  \\
    1 &\text{if} \ {a}_{2}^{2} = 0 
\end{cases}  \]
and so on. More generally, 
\[  \text{for all} \ i \in \N \ {b}_{i} = 
\begin{cases}
    0 &\text{if} \ {a}_{i}^{i} = 1 \\
    1 &\text{if} \ {a}_{i}^{i} = 0 
\end{cases}. \]
Clearly, this sequence \( ({b}_{n}) \) is not the same as any of the sequences of the list above; that is, for all \( i \in \N  \), \( {b}_{i} \neq f(i)  \).
\end{proof} 

\subsection{Preliminary Remarks}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \R  \) is NOT just an ordered field, it has more extra structures.
    \item In \( \R  \), there is a standard notion of length (size, norm) and a corresponding notion of distance.
    \item Given \( a \in \R  \), the \textbf{size} of \( a  \) is defined to be \( | a  |  \). But note that the \textbf{absolute value of \( a \)} is defined as follows:
        \[  | a  |  = 
        \begin{cases}
            a &\text{if} \ a \geq 0 \\
            -a &\text{if} \ a \leq 0.
        \end{cases} \]
    \item Given two numbers \( a  \) and \( b  \) in \( \R  \), the \textbf{standard distance} between \( a  \) and \( b  \) is 
        \[  \dist{(a,b)} = | a - b  |.  \]
    \item The notion of distance plays an essential role in the development of calculus.
    \item When there is a notion of distance, then it will be possible to make sense of statements such as \textit{as \( h \) gets close to zero...}. 
    \item Note that size, length, or norm are all equivalent in describing the size of the difference between two numbers/elements.
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}[Basic Properties of Standard Size in \( \R  \)]
    Let \( a \in \R  \). Then
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(i)] \( |  a  |  \geq 0  \)  
        \item[(ii)] \( |  a  |  = 0  \) if and only if \( a = 0  \). 
        \item [(iii)] \( |  \alpha a  |  = | \alpha  |  | a |  \) for all \( \alpha \in \R  \) and \( a \in \R  \).
        \item[(iv)] \( |  a + b  |  \leq | a  |  + | b  |  \) for all \( a,b \in \R  \).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\begin{remark}
    Note that (iv) is equivalent to saying that 
    \[  -(| a | + | b | ) \leq a + b \leq | a  |  + | b  |.  \]
    This is an immediate consequence of the following inequalities:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(i)] Every \( a \in \R  \), we have \( - | a  |  \leq a \leq | a  |  \) and \( - | b  |  \leq b \leq |  b |  \).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

Is it possible to generalize the notion of "size"? \textbf{YES!}

\begin{definition}[ ]
    Let \( V  \) be a (real) vector space. A function from \( \| \cdot \|:   V \to \R  \) is called a \textbf{norm} on \( V  \) if it satisfies the following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(i)] For all \( x \in V  \), \( \|x \| \geq 0  \) 
        \item[(ii)] For all \( x \in V  \), \( \|x \| = 0  \) if and only if \( x = 0  \).
        \item[(iii)] For all \( \alpha \in \R  \) and \( x \in V  \), \( \| \alpha x \| = | \alpha |  \|x\| \).
        \item[(iv)] For all \( x,y \in V  \), we have
            \[  \|x + y \| \leq \|x\| + \|y\| \ \tag{triangle inequality} \]
\end{enumerate}
A vector space \( V  \) equipped with notion of norm is called a normed space. (Sometimes, we write \( (V , \|\cdot\|) \) is a normed space). So, call \( d(x,y) = \| x - y \| \).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Basic Properties of Standard Distance in \( \R  \)]
    For all \( a,b \in \R  \). 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(i)] \( \dist(a,b) \geq 0  \) 
        \item[(ii)] \( \dist(a,b) = 0  \) if and only if \( a = b  \).
        \item[(iii)] \( \dist(a,b) = \dist(b,a)  \).
        \item[(iv)] For all \( a,b,c \in \R   \), we have  \( \dist(a,c) \leq \dist(a,b) + \dist(b,c) \).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Metric Spaces}

\begin{definition}[Metric Spaces]
Let \(  X \neq \emptyset  \). A function \( d: X \times X \to \R  \) is said to be a \textbf{distance function} or a \textbf{metric} if it satisfies the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] For all \( x,y \in X  \), \( d(x,y) \geq 0  \).
    \item[(ii)] For all \( x,y \in X  \), \( d(x,y) = 0  \) if and only if \( x = y  \).
    \item[(iii)] For all \( x,y \in X  \), \( d(x,y) = d(y,x) \).
    \item[(iv)] For all \( x,y,z \in X  \), \( d(x,y) \leq d(x,z) + d(z,y) \).
\end{enumerate}
A set \( X  \) equipped with a metric \( d  \) is called a \textbf{metric space}. (Sometimes we write \( (X,d)  \) is a metric space)
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    \( X  \) does \textbf{NOT} need to be a vector space. Furthermore, \( d  \) is a more general notion of size than \( \| \cdot \| \).
\end{remark}


\begin{eg}
    \( (\R , d)  \) where \( d: \R \times \R \to [0,\infty)   \) is defined by 
    \[  d(x,y) = |  x - y  |. \]
    (or \( d(x,y) = \alpha |  x - y  |  \) where \( \alpha > 0  \) is a fixed real number)


\end{eg}
