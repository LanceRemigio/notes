    \item[(1)] Every neigborhood is an open set.
    \item[(2)] If \( p  \) is a limit point of a set \( E  \), then every neighborhood of \( p  \) contains infinitely many points of \( E  \). 
    \item[(3)] Theorem: \( E  \) is open \( \Longleftrightarrow \) \( E^{C}   \) is closed.
    \item[(4)] Theorem: arbitrary union of open sets is open, Finite intersection of open sets is open.
    \item[(5)] Theorem: \( \overline{E} \) is the smallest closed subset of \( X  \) that contains \( E  \).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{theorem}[ ]
   Let \( (X,d) \) be a metric space and let \( p \in X  \) and \( \epsilon > 0  \). Every neighborhood is an open set; that is, \( {N}_{\epsilon}(p) \) is an open set.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Our goal is to show that every point of \( {N}_{\epsilon}(p) \) is an interior point of \( {N}_{\epsilon}(p) \). Let \( q \in {N}_{\epsilon}(p) \). We need to show that there exists \( \delta > 0  \) such that \( {N}_{\delta}(q) \subseteq {N}_{\epsilon}(p) \). Let \( \delta = \frac{ \epsilon - d(p,q)  }{ 2 }  \). We claim that \( {N}_{\delta}(q) \) is a subset of \( {N}_{\epsilon}(p) \). Indeed, if \( x \in {N}_{\delta}(q) \), then  
\[  d(q,x) < \delta \Longrightarrow d(q,x) < \epsilon - d(p,q)  \]
and so
\[  d(p,q) + d(q,x) < \epsilon \Longleftrightarrow d(p,x) < \epsilon \tag{triangle inequality}. \]
Thus, \( x \in {N}_{\epsilon}(p) \).

\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[ ]
   If \( p  \) is a limit point of a set \( E  \), then every neighborhood of \( p  \) contains infinitely many points of \( E  \).
