\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a generalization of the spectral theorem from finite-dimensional inner product spaces to the broader context of Hilbert spaces. We focus on the diagonalization of bounded self-adjoint linear operators, examining the structural and functional properties necessary for this extension. In particular, we investigate positive operators, their positive square roots, orthogonal projections, and the spectral families associated with such operators. These tools enable us to represent self-adjoint operators via Riemannâ€“Stieltjes integrals. We conclude by applying the spectral theorem to diagonalize convolution operators, thereby revealing their structure as multiplication operators in the frequency domain. This not only simplifies their analysis but also highlights the deep connection between convolution, Fourier analysis, and the spectral properties of self-adjoint operators.
